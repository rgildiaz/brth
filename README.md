#### Program Note
Generation Z is my personal exploration of generative music. In its original form, this piece was a soundscape texture written entirely in SuperCollider. Using wide vibrato, pure tones, and small sound effects, I searched for a homogenous and ever-changing sound. As I picked this project back up, I decided to set a goal to avoid using a DAW for any post-processing. I wanted to create a system that allows for a unique setting each time it is run. The magic of generative music stems from its inherent fragility. You are given a unique experience that will only happen once. 

As I worked, I found that this fragile balance parallels the unique challenges of growing up in the internet age. Having grown up with an uncountable number of new technologies, I’ve become accustomed to their quick changes and unexpected growth. Generation Z became my attempt to reconcile this, forcing myself to adapt to unpredictable situations and reminding myself not to get lost in the infinite flow of human knowledge. Life will happen once, so don’t get caught up on the things that don’t matter.

While I am happy with the result, as it currently stands, the code used to generate this piece is relatively disorganized and difficult to scale. I plan to continue cleaning up the codebase and to refine some aspects of this composition over time. Some elements of this piece are especially rough around the edges, such as transitions and variations within each section.
